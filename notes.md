# To-Do List
1.  Faster RCNN object detection
2.  Point cloud segmentation with Point Cloud Library
3.  Point cloud clustering (k-mean?)
4.  ApproxMVBB get bounding box of point cloud
5.  Create obstacle for motion planning

# General procedure
1.  2D pose estimate to get initial pose(human input)
2.  Navigate to the door way to the target room
3.  Hand control over to depth camera to navigate through door way
4.  Object detection
5.  Tracker based navigation towards object
6.  Depth camera based grasping
